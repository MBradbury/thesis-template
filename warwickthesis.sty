%%% Copyright (c) 1995 by Dinesh Das.  All rights reserved.
%%% This file is free and can be modified or distributed as long as
%%% you meet the following conditions:
%%%
%%% (1) This copyright notice is kept intact on all modified copies.
%%% (2) If you modify this file, you MUST NOT use the original file name.
%%%
%%% This file defines macros used for preparing theses for
%%% The University of Texas at Austin.  It has been tested with LaTeX2e.
%%% I do NOT guarantee that it will meet all requirements of the
%%% Graduate School; however,
%! neither do I, but I am fairly confident because the university
%regulations are almost minimal.
%! if you find that something violates the
%! specifications, please send me email at <m.j.hadley@warwick.ac.uk>
%! I will try to fix it.
%%%
%%% Usage:
%%% ======
%%%
%%% To use this file with LaTeX2e, make sure your TEXINPUTS environment
%%% variable contains the directory in which this file is located.
%%% Include this file as a package in the preamble:
%%%
%%% \documentclass[...]{report}
%!   \usepackage{wnewthesis}
%%%
%%% On non-UNIX systems, there might be different environment variables
%%% that might need to be set.  I know nothing about such machines,
%%% however; consult your local guru for details.
%%%
%%% A template for a thesis is provided in the file
%!   warwickthesis.tex, available
%%% from the same place where you obtained this file.
%%%
%%% Command Names:
%%% ==============
%%%
%%% ALL command names used in this file that are used to format the
%%% thesis begin with "thesis" (e.g., \thesisauthor).  All of these
%%% commands can be changed by the user using \renewcommand, e.g.,
%%%
%%% \renewcommand{\thesisauthor}{First M. Last}
%%%
%%% after loading the package in LaTeX2e.

  \item \textbf{THESIS DEPOSIT}
  \begin{enumerate}[2.1]
      \item  Under your registration at the University, you are required to deposit your thesis with the University in BOTH hard copy and in digital format. The digital copy should normally be saved as a single pdf file.
      \item The hard copy will be housed in the University Library. The digital copy will be deposited in the University's Institutional Repository (WRAP). Unless otherwise indicated (see 2.6 below), this will be made immediately openly accessible on the Internet and will be supplied to the British Library to be made available online via its Electronic Theses Online Service (EThOS) service. 
%[At present, theses submitted for a Master's degree by Research (MA, MSc, LLM, MS or MMedSci) are not being deposited in WRAP and not being made available via EthOS. This may change in future.] 
      \item In exceptional circumstances, the Chair of the Board of Graduate Studies may grant permission for an embargo to be placed on public access to the thesis \textbf{in excess of two years}. This must be applied for when submitting the thesis for examination (further information is available in the Guide to Examinations for Higher Degrees by Research.)
      \item If you are depositing a thesis for a Master's degree by Research, the options below only relate to the hard copy thesis.
      \item If your thesis contains material protected by third party copyright, you should consult with your department, and if appropriate, deposit an abri\-dged hard and/or digital copy thesis.
      \item Please tick one of the following options for the availability of your thesis (guidance is available in the Guide to Examinations for Higher Degrees by Research): 
      \begin{description}

      \end{description}
      \item The University encourages users of the Library to utilise theses as much as possible, and unless indicated below users will be able to photocopy your thesis.

   \item \textbf{GRANTING OF NON-EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS}\\
Whether I deposit my Work personally or through an assistant or other agent, I agree to the following:
Rights granted to the University of Warwick and the British Library and the user of the thesis through this agreement are non-exclusive. I retain all rights in the thesis in its present version or future versions. I agree that the institutional repository administrators and the British Library or their agents may, without changing content, digitise and migrate the thesis to any medium or format for the purpose of future preservation and accessibility.
  \item  \textbf{ DECLARATIONS}\\[1em] I DECLARE THAT:
\begin{itemize}%[leftmargin=*]
\item I am the author and owner of the copyright in the thesis and/or I have the authority of the authors and owners of the copyright in the thesis to make this agreement. Reproduction of any part of this thesis for teaching or in academic or other forms of publication is subject to the normal limitations on the use of copyrighted materials and to the proper and full acknowledgement of its source.
\item The digital version of the thesis I am supplying is either the same version as the final, hardbound copy submitted in completion of my degree once any minor corrections have been completed, or is an abridged version (see 2.5 above).
\item I have exercised reasonable care to ensure that the thesis is original, and does not to the best of my knowledge break any UK law or other Intellectual Property Right, or contain any confidential material. 
\item I understand that, through the medium of the Internet, files will be available to automated agents, and may be searched and copied by, for example, text mining and plagiarism detection software.
\item At such time that my thesis will be made publically available digitally (see 2.6 above), I grant the University of Warwick and the British Library a licence to make available on the Internet the thesis in digitised format through the Institutional Repository and through the British Library via the EThOS service.
\item If my thesis does include any substantial subsidiary material owned by third-party copyright holders, I have sought and obtained permission to include it in any version of my thesis available in digital format and that this permission encompasses the rights that I have granted to the University of Warwick and to the British Library.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{LEGAL INFRINGEMENTS}\\
I understand that neither the University of Warwick nor the British Library have any obligation to take legal action on behalf of myself, or other rights holders, in the event of infringement of intellectual property rights, breach of contract or of any other right, in the thesis.
