%\doublespacing                     %! uncomment if you want real double-spacing for some perverse reason.

\setlength{\textheight}{8.75in}      %! Uncomment this for a slightly
                                     %! longer page. The default is now 8.5in (from Feb 2010)
                                     %! regulations require page numbers to be at least 1.5cm into the page.
